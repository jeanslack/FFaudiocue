ffaudiocue for Debian

Please edit this to provide information specific to
this ffaudiocue Debian package.

    FFaudiocue is the official GUI for the Python library FFcuesplitter 
    (https://github.com/jeanslack/FFcuesplitter) also designed by the same 
    author/developer of FFaudiocue, an FFmpeg-based audio splitter for CDDA 
    images associated with *.cue files. As an interface, FFaudiocue has been 
    designed with simplicity in mind, allowing most of the operations included 
    in FFcuesplitter to be performed efficiently with just a few mouse clicks.

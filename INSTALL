Important Notes:
----------------

The instructions provided on this file assume you have Python installed and
configured on your operating system.

Currently FFaudiocue is still under development in beta status and no
pre-compiled packages have been distributed, but since it comes with a
`pyproject.toml` file, you can build it and install it very easily into your
operating system.

However, to achieve this a virtual python environment is recommended, for
example using tools like `python3-venv` or `virtualenv`, which once activated,
you can install packages in the virtual environment using pip and then installing
FFaudiocue into it. At present, other installation methods that use
administrative privileges such as superuser or root are strongly discouraged.

-----
Linux
-----

First of all, install the essential packages using the package manager provided
by your linux distribution, then install wxPython version 4.0.7 or higher.
On debian-based distributions (Ubuntu, Kubuntu, Lubuntu, Mint, MXLinux, etc)
this package is identified as `python3-wxgtk4.0` .
Aldo make sure you have `ffmpeg` and `ffprobe` already installed.

Activate your virtual Python directory:
source 'path_to_environment_directory/bin/activate'

To install FFaudiocue, open a terminal window and type:
python3 -m pip install git+https://github.com/jeanslack/FFaudiocue.git@main

OR (alternatively), use requirements.txt file:
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt

To run the program type:
$ ffaudiocue

-------
Windows
-------

Activate your virtual Python directory:
.\path_to_environment_directory\Scripts\activate

To install FFaudiocue type:
python -m pip install git+https://github.com/jeanslack/FFaudiocue.git@main

OR (alternatively), use requirements.txt file:
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt

Make sure you have ffmpeg and ffprobe available somewhere on your system, as
these dependencies are not provided automatically by FFaudiocue.

Once you have ffmpeg and ffprobe, start FFaudiocue (just type ffaudiocue
in your command prompt window), click the Setup button, go to the FFmpeg tab and
provide the location on your file system.

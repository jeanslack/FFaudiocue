IMPORTANT NOTES Using Python
============================

The following instructions assume you have Python installed and configured on
your operating system.

A virtual python environment is recommended, for example using tools like
`python3-venv` or `virtualenv`, which once activated, you can install Python
packages and then installing FFaudiocue into it. At present, other installation
methods that use administrative privileges such as superuser or root are strongly
discouraged.
